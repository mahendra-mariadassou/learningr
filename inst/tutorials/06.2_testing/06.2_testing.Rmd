## Detecting fraud

In this case study, you are a buyer of soda cans and think a seller is cheating you by selling you smaller than advertised. The advertised capacity is 333 mL but you regularly end up needing quite more than 3 cans to fill up 1L bottles and you're starting to get suspicious. 

You want to take the matter into your hands and contact a local measurement laboratory to make independent enquiries. Depending on the results you'll have to change providers. 

You send the lab a pack of 100 randomly sampled cans and it sends you back the 1000 measurements, stored in the object `can_sizes`). Each element of `can_sizes` is the capacity of **one** can. 

## Stating the problem and statistical model. 

Note $\mu$ the **actual** can capacity of your provider and $X_i$ the capacity of can $i$ (measured to be $x_i$). 

Assume the $X_i$ are independent variables and that they all follow a gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with both $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ unknown. 

### Hypothesis testing 

Given the context, you need to choose a null ($H_0$) and an alternative ($H_1$) hypothesis. Your null is obviously: $H_0: \mu = 333$ but you need to think about the alternative. 

```{r q1}
question(
  "What's the alternative hypothesis $H_1$?",
  answer("$\\mu = 333$", correct = FALSE, message = "Definitely not! the alternative must be different from the null!"),
  answer("$\\mu \\neq 333$", correct = FALSE, message = "It could be but you can be more specific here"),
  answer("$\\mu > 333$", correct = FALSE, message = "Is it really a problem for you if your provider sells you larger than advertised cans"),
  answer("$\\mu < 333$", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE, 
  post_message = "You only have a problem if the cans are smaller than expected ($\\mu < 333$). If the cans are larger than expected ($\\mu > 333$), you don't need to take action. You therefore need to gather evidence that the cans are too small. If you wanted well calibrated cans (not too small, not too big), you would choose $\\mu \\neq 333$"
)
```

### Estimator 

**Remark**: In the previous segment, you decided to test $H_0: \mu = 333$ against $H_1: \mu < 333$. You could have decided to test $H_0: \mu \geq 333$ against $H_1: \mu < 333$. Both choices leads to the same estimator and the same decision rule. $\mu = 333$ constitutes a **worst case** scenario of $\mu \geq 333$. Intuitively, it minimizes the difference between $H_0$ and $H_1$. 

You need an estimator of $\mu$ to pursue. Since your statistical model is very simple, you're going to use the usual estimator $\bar{X}$. 

You know that the $\bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2 / n)$ but you don't know $\sigma^2$ so you can't build the decision rule directly from $\bar{X}$. 

You first need to build a statistic whose distribution is known, at least under $H_0$ (i.e. when $\mu = 333$). You can replace $\sigma^2$ with $S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2$ and use instead $T = \frac{\bar{X} - 333}{S/\sqrt{n}}$

```{r q2}
quiz(caption = "distribution of T", 
     question("What is the distribution of T under $H_0$?", 
              answer("A $T(100)$ distribution", correct = FALSE, message = "Almost! Think carefully about the degrees of freedom."), 
              answer("A $T(99)$ distribution", correct = TRUE, message = "Good job!"), 
              answer("None of the above", correct = FALSE, message = "T does follow a Student's t distribution (as suggested by the notation"), 
              allow_retry = TRUE), 
     question("How does it change under $H_1$?", 
              answer("It's shifted to the right", correct = FALSE, message = "Really? Assume $\\mu \\ll 333$ and think about the typical values of $T$."), 
              answer("It's shifted to the left", correct = TRUE, message = "Good job"), 
              answer("It's narrower.", correct = FALSE, message = "Does $\\mu$ affect the spread of the distribution?"), 
              answer("It's broader.", correct = FALSE, message = "Does $\\mu$ affect the spread of the distribution?"), 
              allow_retry = TRUE, 
              post_message = "Indeed, if $\\mu \\ll 333$, $\\bar{X} - 333 \\simeq \\mu - 333$ will be negative and the distribution will be shifted to the left.")
     )
```

Compute the estimation $\hat{\mu}$ of $\mu$. 

```{r compute_mu, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r compute_mu-solution}
mu_hat <- mean(can_sizes)
```

What's the observed value of $T$

```{r compute_t, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r compute_t-solution}
mu_hat <- mean(can_sizes)
sigma_hat <- sd(can_sizes)
n <- length(can_sizes)
t <- (mu_hat - 333)/(sigma_hat / sqrt(n))
```

### Decision rule

Under $H_0$, the distribution of $T$ is centered around $0$ whereas under $H_1$, it's centered around $\sqrt{n}(\mu - 333)/\sigma < 0$. Under $H_1$, $T$ is likely to be smaller that $0$. 

Your reject rejection region should thus take the form $\mathcal{R} = (-\infty, r)$ with a well chosen value of $r$. 


Using the function `qt()` (quantile of the t-distributions), find $r$ such that $P_{H_0}(T \leq r) = \alpha$ (with $\alpha = 0.05$)

```{r find_threshold, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r find_threshold-solution}
qt(p = 0.05, df = 99)
```

```{r q3}
question("Given your previous answer would you", 
         answer("reject $H_0$", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes indeed"), 
         answer("not reject $H_0$", correct = FALSE, message = "Compute $t$, $r$ and compare both."), 
         allow_retry = TRUE, 
         post_message = "Indeed, you found $t = -9.29$ and $r = -1.660391$, since $t < r$, you reject $H_0$."
         )
```

### p-value

The previous results allowed you to reject $H_0$ at level $\alpha = 0.05$. $\alpha$ controls the frequency of type I errors (where the can sizes really have a mean of 333 but your sample is quite atypical and makes you conclude otherwise)

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Type I errors"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/type_1_errors.png")
```

But what about other values of $\alpha$? 

Compute rejection threshold for $\alpha = 10^{-2}$, $\alpha = 10^{-10}$ and $\alpha = 10^{-18}$

```{r find_threshold_alpha, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r find_threshold_alpha-solution}
qt(p = c(1e-2, 1e-10, 1e-18), df = 99)
```

```{r q4}
question("What levels would you reject $H_0$ at?", 
         answer("$\\alpha = 10^{-2}$", correct = TRUE), 
         answer("$\\alpha = 10^{-10}$", correct = TRUE),
         answer("$\\alpha = 10^{-18}$", correct = FALSE),
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```

Repeating the process of computing $r$ for various values of $\alpha$ and comparing it to $t$ is tedious. You can avoid it by computing 
$$
p = P_{H_0}(T \leq t)
$$
Or graphically ($p$ is very small here, you can't really see the corresponding area).

```{r}
t <- (mean(can_sizes) - 333)/(sd(can_sizes)/sqrt(length(can_sizes)))
a <- qt(p = 0.05, df = 99) 
x <- c(seq(-10, 10, length.out = 1001)) %>% unique() %>% sort()
df <- tibble(x = x, 
             d = dnorm(x), 
             side = if_else(x < a, "lower", "greater"))
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = d)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_area(aes(y = d, fill = side)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(lower = "darkred", greater = "transparent"), guide = "none") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = a, color = "darkred", linetype = 2) +
  annotate(x = a, y = dt(a, df = 99), hjust = 0, vjust = 0, geom = 'text', label = "alpha", parse = TRUE, color = "darkred") +
  annotate(x = a, y = 0, hjust = -1, vjust = 0, geom = 'text', label = "r", parse = TRUE, color = "darkred") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = t, color = "red", linetype = 2) +
  annotate(x = t, y = 0, hjust = -1, vjust = 0, geom = 'text', label = "t", parse = TRUE, color = "red") +
  annotate(x = t, y = 0.05, hjust = -1, vjust = 0, geom = 'text', label = "p", parse = TRUE, color = "red")
```

By definition of $p$, as soon as $\alpha > p$, you can reject $H_0$ at level $\alpha$. This is the so-called $p$-value. Intuitively, the lower the p-value, the better your evidence against $H_0$. 

Compute the p-value of your test:
```{r compute_p, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r compute_p-hint}
"Use pt() with the right value for the degree of freedom"
```

```{r compute_p-solution}
t <- -9.29062
pt(t, df = 99)
```

### One-liner

Typing all of the above to compute $\hat{\mu}$, $\hat{\sigma}$, $t$ and $p$ is not very convenient. Fortunately, `R` provides the `t.test()` function to spare you some typing:

```{r}
t.test(x = can_sizes, mu = 333, alternative = "less")
```

where you specified that you're doing a one sample t-test and are testing $H_0 : \mu = 333$ (`mu` argument) against $H_0 : \mu < 333$ (`alternative` argument). 

See how the output provides you with a nice summary of the test statitic (`t`), the degree of freedom (`df`), the p-value (`p-value`) that you computed manually. It also gives you $\hat{\mu}$.

```{r q5}
quiz(caption = "t test", 
     question("Do you have convincing evidence that you provider is cheating you?", 
     answer("Yes", correct = TRUE), 
     answer("No", correct = FALSE), 
     post_message = "With a p-value as small as 1.929e-15, it's very unlikely that you ended with a mean capacity of 330.0975 in your sample just by chance. The provider is cheating you of roughly 1% of your due."), 
     question("How would you perform a test of $H_0: \\mu = 333$ against $H_0: \\mu \\neq 333$?", 
              answer('`t.test(x = can_sizes, mu = 333, alternative = "greater")`', correct = FALSE), 
              answer('`t.test(x = can_sizes, mu = 333, alternative = "two.sided")`', correct = TRUE, message = "You can even omit as it's the defaut value of alternative"))
)
```

**Bonus** You can use `t.test()` to quickly a confidence interval of $\hat{\mu}$ at any level 
```{r}
t.test(x = can_sizes, conf.level = 0.99)
```

The p-value is not really interesting here (we just tested $H_0: \mu = 0$ against $H_0: \mu \neq 0$ which is stupid in that context) but we 99% percent confidence interval is [329.2770, 330.9181]. 

```{r q6}
question("Which of the following are 95% confidence intervals of $\\mu$", 
         answer("[329.4777, 330.7174]", correct = TRUE), 
         answer("($-\\infty$, 330.6163]", correct = TRUE), 
         answer("(329.5788, $\\infty$)", correct = TRUE), 
         allow_retry = TRUE, post_message = "All of them are valid 95% confidence interval (you can check by changing the alternative in the previous call) but the first is optimal as it's the smallest one.")
```

## Changing provider

Based on your previous investigations, you decide to change providers for a more honest one. 

But all providers are closed now due to the coronavirus...

<!--   answer("The estimates are less dispersed.", correct = TRUE, message = "Yes, different estimates become similar when n increases"), -->
<!--   allow_retry = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Creating many estimates -->

<!-- We just illustrated something you've seen in class, the estimate depends on the *sample*. Since `compute_estimate` creates a new sample each times it's called, it will never (or only rarely) produce exactly the same estimate.  -->

<!-- Our estimator $\bar{Y}$ is a *random variable*, if we had access to its distribution we could compute its bias and and variance. Here we don't know (yet) the exact distribution of $\bar{Y}$ yet. We're thus going to look only at its distribution instead by creating many estimates (say 100, numbered from 1 to 100) for each sample size in $\{10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000\}$.  -->

<!-- We first create a tibble with all combination and then compute an estimate with our function `compute_estimate` for each combination. The syntax is a bit involved but don't worry too much about it as it's not the main purpose.  -->

<!-- ```{r estimates_data, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, include = TRUE} -->
<!-- estimates_data <- crossing(sample_size = c(10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000),  -->
<!--                            estimate_number = 1:100) %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(estimate_value = map_dbl(sample_size, compute_estimate)) -->
<!-- estimates_data -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We just created 100 estimates for each of the 6 sample sizes considered.  -->

<!-- ### Distibution of the estimates -->

<!-- You're now going to explore the distribution of those estimates. Use ggplot to explore the distribution of the data, make sure to separate the estimates by sample size.  -->

<!-- ```{r plot_estimate, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ggplot(estimates_data, ...) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r plot_estimate-hint-1} -->
<!-- "Use `geom_density()` or `geom_histogram()` and `facet_wrap()`" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r plot_estimate-solution} -->
<!-- ggplot(estimates_data, aes(x = estimate_value)) +  -->
<!--   geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +  -->
<!--   geom_vline(xintercept = 330, color = "red") + ## advertised capacity -->
<!--   facet_wrap(~sample_size) + ## separate the data by sample_size -->
<!--   labs(x = "Estimate", y = "Density") ## Nice labels -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Characterizing the distribution -->

<!-- The previous graph illustrates a very general result in statistics: **the larger the sample, the more accurate the estimate**. There are of course exceptions (especially if the estimator is biased) but as a good rule of thumbs, _more is better_. Let's characterize the distribution of the estimates for each class size.  -->

<!-- Compute the minimium, maximum, average and standard deviation of the estimate values for each sample size.  -->

<!-- ```{r sam_size_mean_sd, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- estimates_data %>% ... -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r sam_size_mean_sd-hint} -->
<!-- "Use `group_by()` and `summarize()`" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r sam_size_mean_sd-solution} -->
<!-- estimates_summary <- estimates_data %>%  -->
<!--   group_by(sample_size) %>%  -->
<!--   summarize(estimate_sd   = sd(estimate_value),  -->
<!--             estimate_mean = mean(estimate_value), -->
<!--             estimate_min  = min(estimate_value),  -->
<!--             estimate_max  = max(estimate_value)) -->
<!-- estimates_summary -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r sam_size_mean_sd-check} -->
<!-- "Good job! Note that the range and standard deviation of the estimate values decrease with sample size." -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Understanding the distribution -->

<!-- The previous graphs and tables tell us that: -->

<!-- - the estimates are centered around the same value (~ 330) for all sample sizes -->
<!-- - the spread of the estimates decreases as sample size increases.  -->

<!-- Indeed when using only 10 cans to assess the capacity, the estimate $\hat{\mu}$ can be anywhere between 320 and 340 whereas it is very concentrated around 330 when 5000 cans.  -->

<!-- Using the previous results, find a scaling relation between `estimate_sd` and `sample_size` -->

<!-- ```{r estimates_summary} -->
<!-- estimates_summary <- estimates_data %>%  -->
<!--   group_by(sample_size) %>%  -->
<!--   summarize(estimate_sd   = sd(estimate_value),  -->
<!--             estimate_mean = mean(estimate_value), -->
<!--             estimate_min  = min(estimate_value),  -->

<!--   answer("5000", correct = TRUE, message = "Since the standard deviation is ~ 0.208, the typical spread will be 0.42, lower than 1") -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Bias and Variance -->

<!-- To go further and compute the bias and variance of our estimate, we need to know the theoretical distribution of our estimate.  -->

<!-- Assume that the can capacitites are independant and follow a normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  -->

<!-- The theory informs us that  -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{1}^n Y_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- In particular, $E[\bar{Y}] = \mu$ and $V[\bar{Y}] = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.  -->

<!-- As $n$ increases, the variance of $\bar{Y}$ decreases as $\frac{1}{n}$ and thus is standard deviation as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. This is in line with our findings from the previous section.  -->

<!-- The formula also tells us that $\bar{Y} \to \mu$ when $n \to \infty$.  -->

<!-- ### Convergence of $\bar{Y}$  -->

<!-- We're going to investigate this convergence by looking at estimates computed on increasingly large samples: the first 10 cans, the first 11 cans, etc.  -->

<!-- Write a function to compute the capacity estimate from the first $n$ cans in `can_container` (and not from a random sample): -->

<!-- ```{r compute_estimate_2, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- compute_estimate_2 <- function(n) { -->
<!--   estimate <- ### complete here -->
<!--   return(estimate) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r compute_estimate_2-solution} -->
<!-- compute_estimate_2 <- function(n) { -->
<!--   estimate <- mean(can_container[1:n]) -->
<!--   return(estimate) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can then look at the evolution of the estimate when you increase the sample size from $n = 1$ to $n = 50,000$ (there is no real point looking at larger sample sizes).  -->

<!-- ```{r compute_estimate_2-setup} -->
<!-- compute_estimate_2 <- function(n) { -->
<!--   estimate <- mean(can_container[1:n]) -->
<!--   return(estimate) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r estimates_convergence_echo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- estimates_convergence <- tibble(sample_size = seq(from = 10, to = 50000, by = 1)) %>% -->
<!--   mutate(estimate_value = map_dbl(sample_size, compute_estimate_2)) -->
<!-- estimates_convergence -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r estimates_convergence, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE} -->
<!-- estimates_convergence <- tibble(sample_size = seq(from = 10, to = 50000, by = 1)) %>% -->
<!--   mutate(estimate_value = cumsum(can_container)[sample_size] / sample_size) -->
<!-- estimates_convergence -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And plot the convergence of $\hat{\mu}$ to $\mu$ as a $n \to \infty$.  -->

<!-- ```{r estimates_convergence_plot, exercise = TRUE} -->
<!-- ggplot(...) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r estimates_convergence_plot-solution} -->
<!-- ggplot(estimates_convergence, aes(x = sample_size, y = estimate_value)) +  -->
<!--   geom_line() + -->
<!--   geom_hline(yintercept = 330, color = "red") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Confidence interval  -->

<!-- In this section, we'll illustrate a few properties of confidence intervals.  -->

<!-- ### Known variance -->

<!-- Assume for now that $\sigma^2$ is knonw. We learned in the previous section that $\bar{Y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$ or equivalently that the pivotal statistic  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Z = \frac{\bar{Y} -\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- In particular, the distribution of $Z$ depends on neither $\mu$ nor $\sigma$ and can be used to construct *confidence intervals* (see [Tristan's slides](https://moodle.cri-paris.org/pluginfile.php/26108/mod_resource/content/1/Session4.pdf) for details).  -->

<!-- In that simple case, to compute a confidence interval at level $1 - \alpha$, we simply need to find $a$ and $b$ such that  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- P(a \leq Z \leq b) = 1 - \alpha -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- You've seen in class that the **optimal** solution was: -->

<!-- - $a = q_{\alpha/2}$  -->
<!-- - $b = q_{1 - \alpha/2}$  -->

<!-- where $q_\beta$ is the quantile or order $\beta$ of the normal distribution, computed with the function `qnorm()`.  -->

<!-- In fact, for every $\beta \leq \alpha$ we could set $a = q_{\beta}$ and $b = q_{1 - \alpha + \beta}$ to obtain a solution as:  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- P(a \leq Z \leq b) = P(Z \leq q_{1 - \alpha + \beta}) - P(Z \leq q_{\beta}) = (1 - \alpha + \beta) - \beta = 1 - \alpha -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Thanks to the properties of independent $\chi^2$ and gaussian variables (we've not properly shown that $S$ and $(\bar{Y} - \mu)/\sigma$ are independent, you'll have to trust me on that one), our statistic is pivotal and follows a Student's t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.  -->

<!-- ### Understanding confidence intervals (I) -->

<!-- In the previous section, we learned how to replace $\sigma^2$ with its estimator to obtain a pivotal statistics. If we note $t_{n, \beta}$ the quantile of order $\beta$ of $\mathcal{T}(n)$. We can build a confidence interval of level $1-\alpha$ for $\mu$ as follows: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!-- & P\left(t_{n-1, \alpha/2} \leq T \leq t_{n-1, 1 - \alpha/2} \right) = 1 - \alpha \\ \Rightarrow & P\left(t_{n-1, \alpha/2} \leq \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{S/\sqrt{n}} \leq t_{n-1, 1 - \alpha/2} \right) = 1 - \alpha \\  -->
<!-- \Rightarrow & P\left( \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}t_{n-1, \alpha/2} \leq \bar{Y} - \mu \leq \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} t_{n-1, 1 - \alpha/2} \right) = 1 - \alpha \\ -->
<!-- \Rightarrow & P\left( \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}t_{n-1, \alpha/2} - \bar{Y} \leq -\mu \leq \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} t_{n-1, 1 - \alpha/2}  - \bar{Y} \right) = 1 - \alpha \\ -->
<!-- \Rightarrow & P\left( \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}t_{n-1, 1 - \alpha/2} + \bar{Y} \leq \mu \leq - \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} t_{n-1, \alpha/2} + \bar{Y} \right) = 1 - \alpha \\  -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Since $\mathcal{T}(n-1)$ has a symmetric distribution, $t_{n-1, \frac{\alpha}{2}} = - t_{n-1, 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}}$ and the previous equality is often written  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- P\left( \mu \in \left[ \bar{Y} \pm \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} t_{n-1, 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \right] \right) = 1 - \alpha -->

<!-- ### Understanding confidence intervals (II) -->

<!-- Confidence interval are a bit tricky to understand: -->

<!-- - the interval $CI(1-\alpha) = \left[ \bar{Y} \pm \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} t_{n-1, 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \right]$ is a random variable -->
<!-- - but $\mu$ is a real number -->

<!-- Therefore, when replacing $\bar{Y}$ and $S$ with $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$ to compute the confidence interval, $\mu$ is either *inside* $\left[ \hat{\mu} \pm \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n}} t_{n-1, 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \right]$ or *outside*. The proper way to understand confidence intervals is to remember that _$IC(1-\alpha)$ covers $\mu$ with probability 1-$\alpha$_. Stated differently, on average a fraction $1 - \alpha$ of the confidence intervals you compute will *contain* the real value $\mu$.  -->

<!-- Let's illustrate that with 100 estimates $\hat{\mu}$ of $\mu$ and the corresponding confidence interval of level 0.95. Each estimate $\hat{\mu}$ is a point, each confidence interval is a linerange, the true value of $\mu$ is indicated by the red line and the confidence intervals are colored in black if they cover the true value and in red if they don't. In this (perfect) example, 5% of the 95% CI do not cover $\mu$.  -->
